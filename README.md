## 👨‍💻 About Me  

I’m Saumya Patel, recently graduated with First Class honours in Computer Engineering from the University of Greenwich. My main programming language is **Python**, which I use to build AI‑powered summarisation tools, automation scripts, and data‑driven web applications. Through Python, I’ve explored **machine learning, generative AI, natural language processing, data handling, and backend development with FastAPI and Flask**.

I’m also fluent in **JavaScript, React, C++, Java, and SQL,** giving me a balanced understanding of both frontend interactivity and backend logic. On the systems side, I’ve worked extensively in **Linux environments**, developed for **Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and BeagleBone**, and gained hands‑on experience with **IoT integration, networking (Cisco), and embedded systems**.

I value simplicity, persistence, and clear communication—principles that shape how I write code, collaborate with teams, and turn ideas into reliable solutions. I’m eager to join a team where I can keep learning, contribute to scalable products, and grow as a Python engineer.
